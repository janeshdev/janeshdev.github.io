			<p>It is a motivational book written by Paulo Coelho. This is the second time I have read this book. I didn't find this book as interesting as I found the first time. I read this as a audiobook from Hoopla. This however, is an interesting read with the main theme "When you want something so bad, the whole universe conspires to lead you to the path of your treasure". It urges the readers to find the personal legend which is unique to the individuals. </p>
