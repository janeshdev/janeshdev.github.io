        <h3> Belief </h3>
        Date: 2022-11-17

        <p> Belief is a very interesting subject and in my opinion the most powerful asset humans have and can use it to shape their lives, achieve anything they want in their life. I have been reading a lot of non-fiction books and listening to podocasts on self improvement and learned that an extraordinary achievement or successful habit stems from the belief. This very blog stems from my belief that I will become a public speaker one day and stepping stones such as blogs / articles like this would help me reach that goal. The basic theme that I have come across in all the resources in self improvement and personal growth is that everything starts with belief. A belief that you can change, a belief that you can be the change you are looking for, a belief that you shall see the sunrise of hope, a belief that your country would be independent, a belief that all Americans would be equal, a belief that handicapped person can run, a belief that you shall lead your country after 30 years of prison, a belief that non-violence can bring freedeom, a belief that you shall read despite being visually impaired, a belief that you can run a mile in 4 minutes and many more. Everything starts in your mind and imagination stems from your belief. </p>

        <p>
            Reading think and grow Rich, I learned that unless you believe you are going to achieve certain things within certain time frame, it would be very difficult to achieve what you desire in life. There are several examples in that book regarding imagination and belief. The belief that Barnes desire of working with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford creating an automobile and the diggers belief to find the coal mine etc. 

        </p>

        <p>
            These days a lot of us might have come across self healing of belief based healing from your will or imagination. I also feel that everything Dr. Joe Dispenza teaches / shares about shaping the mind starts with the belief of the person. I haven't read Bible but have crome across the verse several times, "Ask, and it shall be given to you, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you". So if we have the belief and desire to achieve something we will be able to do that. We need to follow the thirteen principles as described in Think and Grow Rich. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            I would like to give an example of human endurance, an American ultramarathon runner, ultra-distance cyclist, triathere, public speaker, and author David Goggins who is a retired United States Navy Seal and former United states Air Force tactical Air Control party member who served in the Iraq war. David Goggin's belief and determination of not giving joy to the tormentors or dark side under any endurance and pain is a great example that humans can achieve anything beyond the norms we have read and been taught. He believes like in the car there is governer that tells the maximum limit of that car is 120 / 140 depending on the make and model, our human mind also has governance. Once we go past that governance, the potential is immense. He says the humans are operating at maximum 40% of their ability and challenges all of us to believe and go beyond that 40% governance. There is a green space on the other side which has yet to be discovered which can only be accessed through extreme belief and imagination. I recommend listening to David Goggins and reading his book "Can't hurt me". Even the famous fiction series "Harry Potter" portrays that based on his and his teacher's belief Harry Potter was able to end Lord Valdemort who was more powerful and knew more magic and sorcery than Harry. Another person I really admire is Andrew Huberman and his belief that every public should get the science based education for free has now gained more than 2 million youtube subscribers all around the world in very short period of time. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            <b>How do you develop and harness belief?</b>
        </p>
            <p> The resources I have come across to devlop the beliefs are ; meditation, affirmations, atomic habits that helps us to break down the goal or belief. Books I recommend</p>
            <li> Think and grow Rich</li>
            <li> Atomic Habits</li>

        <p>
            The question we have to ask ourselves is how bad do we want to change. Is the desire bigger than the desire to sleep, eat? The desire and belief has to be so big that anything else that's going on in your life then you can achieve anything you desire. There are a lots of excuses we hear on a daily basis; I don't have enough time, I hate to do exercise but want to be fit, I wish I had free time like Mr. X etc. I would request these people to sit down on the table with a piece of paper and write anything they desire and believe that what they want is possible. They just need continued belief and need to trade some of their secondary interests and prioritize their interest to be fit or wealthy or educated whatever it could be.
